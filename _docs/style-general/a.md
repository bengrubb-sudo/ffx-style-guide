{:#abbreviations-acronyms} abbreviations (acronyms)
: Most abbreviations commonly pronounced as words are rendered in caps: *AIDS*, *ANZUS*, *APEC*, *ASEAN*, *ASIO*, *ASIS*, *NASA*, *NATO*, *OPEC*, *UNESCO*, *UNICEF*. Anzac is an exception. Acronyms such as *eftpos, laser*, *scuba* and *radar* have passed into the language as words in their own right and are all lower case. Accepted abbreviations are listed throughout this guide stating when they can be used at first reference or at second reference after being spelt out in full. Rarely is it necessary to put the abbreviation in brackets immediately after the spelt-out form. Do this only where extra clarity is required, such as for some foreign political party names where the full name is given in English but the abbreviation the party is known by is based on the foreign name.

{:#abbreviations-honorifics} abbreviations (honorifics)
: Abbreviate only these: *Mr*, *Mrs*, *Messrs*, *Cr* (for *Councillor*), *Dr*, *St* (for *Saint*); no full points. (*Ms*, not an abbreviation, is listed elsewhere.) Spell out *Sergeant*, *Lieutenant-General* and others. Also see **honorifics**, **St (for Saint).** (TODO)

{:#abbreviations-initial-letters} abbreviations (initial letters)
: No full points (in text or in headings) in abbreviations such as *ALP*, *US*, *ACTU*, *MP*, *MLA*, *VC*, *MBE*, *BA*, *LLB*, *BEc, PhD, DLit* etc. Use full points for personal initials, e.g. *Mr A. C. Smith* (with a thin space in print between *A.* and *C).*

{:#abbreviations-organisations} abbreviations (organisations)
: In most cases an organisation's name should be used in full at first reference and shortened later. Also in most cases, initials should be used only where instantly recognisable. Otherwise use: *the association*, *the board*, *the union*, *the council*, *the company*, *the commission*, *the league*, etc (all lower case). A few well-recognised abbreviations (e.g. *ABC*, *ACTU*, *AFL*, *MCG*, *NRL*, *SCG*) may be used at first reference. When such terms as *Australian*, *Victorian*, *NSW*, *national*, *federal*, *Melbourne* or *Sydney* are omitted from an organisation's name but the name is substantially intact, retain caps, e.g. *the* (*Australian*) *Broadcasting Tribunal*, *the* (*Australian*) *Taxation Office*, *the* (*National*) *Farmers Federation*. But lower case *the tribunal*, *the council*, *the* (*Victorian*, *NSW*) *police*, when the name is reduced this far. Where a number of groups appear in the one story, initials are permitted for clarity. Initials in brackets after the full version are rarely needed.

{:#abbreviations-states-and-territories)} abbreviations (states and territories)
: *NSW* and *the* *ACT* are always abbreviated. In general spell out other names in copy. Where abbreviated in graphics or lists, use: *SA*, *WA*, *NT*, *Qld*, *Tas*, *Vic*. Avoid *Vic* and *Tas* in headlines.

{:#abbreviations-money} abbreviations (money)
: See **figures 2**. (TODO)

{:#abbreviations-weights-and-measures} abbreviations (weights and measures)
: In routine copy, spell out metric units: *He walked six kilometres*; *A is 74 kilometres from B*; *a five-metre fence*; *a six-hectare block*; *7.8 centimetres*; *10 square kilometres*; *2 million square kilometres*; *two kilograms of sausages*. Metric units may be abbreviated only in tables, graphs, lists (such as auctions and recipes) and in cases of special need such as sport, property or financial market pages, where a lot of numbers, weights or distances have to be mentioned. Do not use a space between numerals and common abbreviated measures, although tsp and tbsp take spaces in recipe ingredient lists. Use *km/h* at all references (*3km/h*, no space). The nautical mile and the knot are recognised in the metric system. In air navigation, altitude is measured in feet but distance in nautical miles. See also **weights and measures**. (TODO)

{:#abbreviations-service-ranks} abbreviations (service ranks)
: See [armed services](#armed-services).

{:#a-bomb} A-bomb
: OK for headings, along with *H-bomb*, *N-bomb*, *and* *N-test*, but don't use in text, except in direct quotes.

{:#Aboriginal people/Torres Strait Islanders} Aboriginal people/Torres Strait Islanders
: Opinions differ on the most appropriate way to refer to the first inhabitants of Australia. Avoid *Aborigine,* which has fallen out of favour in many quarters. Use the adjective *Aboriginal,* as in *Aboriginal people, Aboriginal person, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.* Or use *Indigenous person/ Indigenous people (*note the capital I). *Black* as a noun should not be used in reference to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people unless in direct quotes. Adjectival use should generally be avoided but is allowed when it is considered, respectful and kept to a minimum. *Aboriginal* does not describe Torres Strait Islander people. In Victoria and parts of NSW, many people prefer to be known as Koori (plural Kooris). People can also be referred to by their language/cultural group (*a Wurundjeri man, a Warlpiri woman*). Many Indigenous people around Australia are highly sensitive to the naming and use of photographs of people who have died. Traditional and semi-traditional peoples frequently use grieving names to describe the dead, but these vary from group to group, or according to the wishes of the deceased, the family and community, the length of the grieving period, and even location. See also **race, race and nationality**. (TODO)

Think of more sensible linkages of ideas and events: *Millions will be stranded because transport workers are on strike...* *Millions will be stranded on Tuesday following a decision by transport workers ... Millions of commuters will be stranded by a strike on Tuesday.*

{:#after-2} after (2)
: Another way in which this word is often used foolishly: *A man was killed after he was hit by a train at a level crossing* ... He survived the impact, presumably, but the train driver was extremely irritated about the dent in his locomotive. Say *killed when* or *died after*.

{:#afterwards} afterwards
: 

{:#age-the} Age, The
: The Age Company Pty Ltd is the *publisher* of *The Age,* not *owner.* The owner is Fairfax Media. Do not use italics for sections of the paper or digital sites.

{:#ages-past} ages (past)
: Cap *Stone Age*, *Iron Age*, *Middle Ages* etc. See **historic (and prehistoric) ages**. (TODO)

{:#aggravate} aggravate
: (Things, not people.) It means to make a wrong or a complaint worse. Its use for *annoy* or *irritate* is colloquial.

{:#aid} aid
: *Help* or *assist* often sounds better and gives copy a touch of variety.

{:#aide} aide
: Nursing, presidential etc.

{:#aids} AIDS
: For *acquired immune deficiency syndrome*. People with AIDS should not be tagged victims, and we should be wary of the phrase *innocent victims* as this makes a moral judgment. HIV-positive people do not have AIDS unless they have symptoms linked to the condition.

{:#airconditioned-airconditioning} airconditioned, airconditioning
: No hyphens.

{:#aircraft} aircraft
: *Aircraft* and *plane* are acceptable (*aeroplane* has become dated, *airplane* is American). *Aircraft* is also generic, covering planes, helicopters and lighter-than-air craft. Check in *Jane's All the World's Aircraft* or on company websites for the maker's style for aircraft types. Common examples include *Airbus A380*, *Boeing 747*, *Boeing 747SP*, *Boeing 747-200B*, *DC-9*, *DC-10* (hyphen), *F-18* (technically *F/A- 18*), *F-111*, *Fokker F28*, *B-17,* *MiG* (*MiG-*21 etc), *De Havilland* (two *L*s), *Messerschmitt*.

{:#airfare} airfare
: 

{:#air-force} air force
: Two words. For air force ranks, see [armed services](#armed-services).

{:#airlift} airlift
: It should be reserved for large-scale operations, e.g. the Berlin Airlift; an airlift of food and medical supplies to the flood zone. Avoid it as a verb; rather than *The survivors were airlifted* *to safety*, say they were *flown* to safety.

{:#airlines} airlines
: *Air China* but also *China Airlines*; *Air India*; *All Nippon Airways* (ANA at second reference); *Finnair* (one word); Air Niugini; *Japan Airlines* (not *Air*); *Jetstar*; *Malaysia Airlines* (not *Malaysian*); *Singapore Airlines* (not *Air*); *Thai Airways* (*Thai* at second reference); *Vietnam Airlines*.

: Use *all* or *all the* rather than *all of the*. But *Not all of us agree*.

{:#allahu-akbar} Allahu Akbar
: (God is great).

{:#alleged} alleged
: A useful writ-saver when used judiciously and specifically: *the alleged offence*, *the alleged rape*, *the alleged libel*, *the alleged murder*. But it is not necessary to say someone is being tried for *alleged murder*. Even if the defence contends that no murder was committed, there is no question that the accused is being tried for murder and the jury trying the charge will decide whether he is guilty; *he faces a murder charge*, and his trial is *a murder trial*. These terms are objective, and safe. Similarly, a news organisation is sued for libel (not sued for *alleged* libel) and a writ claims damages for libel.

{:#allies} Allies
: Capped only when referring to *the Allied powers* of the two world wars.

{:#all-right} all right
: Not *alright*.

{:#all-time} all-time

{:#all-together-altogether} all together/altogether

{:#allude} allude
: To *allude* to something is to refer indirectly to something already known. It does not mean to mention directly. *The Treasurer appeared to allude to last year's budget deficit*. But not *The president alluded to last week's game in his report*.

{:#all-wheel-drive} all-wheel-drive
: Can be abbreviated to AWD at second mention.

{:#almanac} almanac
: But *Whitaker's Almanack* and *Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack*.

{:#almost-never} almost never
: Do not use. Say *seldom* or *hardly ever*.

{:#alongside} alongside
: (a ship, wharf etc). Not *alongside of*. Also see **outside of**. (TODO)

{:#alp} ALP
: The *Australian Labor Party* is spelt thus, but the *British*, *Israeli* and *New Zealand Labour parties* and the *International Labour Organisation* have a "u". Cap the factions of the Australian Labor Party: *Left*, *Socialist Left*, *Right*, *Centre-Left*, *Centre Unity*. Generally there is no need to spell out ALP.

{:#al-qaeda} al-Qaeda
: 

{:#also} also
: This word should not be used superfluously and repetitively. It is not necessary to throw it in whenever a new point is introduced. However, *Mr Jones said he disliked such superfluities. He also said redundant phrasing gave him the vapours*.

{:#alternate-alternative} alternate/alternative
: *Alternate* the adjective is not to be used for *alternative*. It means being taken, done etc by turns. Thus: *He went to Europe each alternate* (every second) *year*. But: *He chose an alternative course* (another one open to him). Also: *alternate* (in the sense of deputy, substitute) *chairman*, *director*, *delegate* etc. *Alternative* the noun is one of a pair or set of choices. Despite the popular misconception, there can be more than one alternative (see the *Oxford*, and *Fowler's Modern English Usage*). Take care with copy from America, where ''alternate'' is used for ''alternative''.

{:#altitude} altitude
: Altitude readings for aircraft are expressed in feet, not metres.

{:#aluminium} aluminium
: Watch out for the American spelling, *aluminum*. *Alumina* is the oxide of aluminium.

{:#alzheimers-disease} Alzheimer's disease
: 

{:#am-pm} am/pm
: No full points, no space: 2pm, 7.35am. Beware redundancies such as *3am in the morning* and *9pm at night*. Use *noon or midnight, not 12am or 12pm.*

{:#ambassador} ambassador
: Lower case. Likewise *embassy*, *consul*, *consulate*, *high commissioner*, *high commission*, even when the nationality is attached: *the French ambassador*.

{:#ambulance} ambulance
: Ambulance officers are now called *paramedics*.

{:#americanisms} Americanisms
: Use Australian words. American usage, pouring out of television and radio, can deafen us to our common speech. Avoid such terms as *consult with*, *face up to*, *check up on*, *meet up with*, *sidewalk* or *elevator*. Once dismissed as an Americanism, *apartment* is now commonly used in Australia and is acceptable for *flat* or *unit*. The traditional Australian way of *standing* for election is threatened by the American term *running*, the word *secret* by *classified* and our *holidays* by *vacations*. Use Fairfax style when spelling American institutions, places etc. For example, the *US Defence Department*, *the World Trade Centre*, *New York Harbour*, *Pearl Harbour.* Do not use the following words as verbs: *author*, *guest*, *impact*, *loan*.
: And avoid the following Americanisms -- use Australian English instead:
: additionally → and
: auto → car, vehicle
: brownout → blackout
: check → cheque
: cookies → biscuits
: checkers → draughts
: diaper → nappy
: drugstore → pharmacy
: elevator → lift
: fall → autumn

: plow → plough
: power outage → power cut
: sidewalk → footpath
: skeptic → sceptic
: transportation → transport
: trunk (of a car) → boot

{:#americas-cup} America's Cup
: It is possessive because it was first won by the yacht America. But *Americas Cup* in golf; the *Americas* as in the continents of North America and South America (including, of course, Central America).

{:#amid} amid
: Not *amidst*.

{:#amok} amok
: Not *amuck*.

{:#among} among
: Not *amongst*. See **between**. (TODO)

{:#anaemia} anaemia
: 

{:#anaesthetic} anaesthetic
: 

{:#analog} analog
: Computers.

{:#and} and
: Usual punctuation: *She plays cricket, golf and football*. Sometimes, for clarity, it is helpful to use a comma before *and*: *Follow the dry gully*, *the creek as far as the waterhole*, *and the track up the hillside*. Look out for the blunder that Fowler calls bastard enumeration: *Follow the dry gully*, *walk down the creek as far as the waterhole*, *and up the hillside*. Rather, *Follow the dry gully*, *the creek as far as the waterhole, and walk up the hillside.* The conjunctions *and*, *but*, *or* must connect like forms of words, as in the examples in the preceding paragraph. In the first blunder above, *and* has been made to connect two verbs (*follow, walk*) and a preposition (*up*); in the second, two nouns (*gully, creek*) and a verb (*walk*).

{:#and-which} and which 
: See **which** in the [grammar guide](#grammar).

{:#aneurysm} aneurysm
: Not *aneurism*.

{:#antarctica-or-the-antarctic} Antarctica or the Antarctic
: *Antarctic* is the adjective. Do not omit the first *c*.

{:#antecedents} antecedents
: This does not mean *ancestors*, *forefathers*. In the most common correct use, your antecedents are your history (in police jargon, your criminal history).

{:#antenna} antenna
: Plural *antennae* of insects, *antennas* of radio or TV.

{:#anti-words} anti words
: WITHOUT HYPHENS: antibacterial, antibiotic, antibody, Antichrist, anticlimax, anticlockwise, anticoagulant, antidepressant, antifreeze, antihistamine, antimalarial, antimatter, antioxidant, antipasto, antiperspirant, antivenom.

: 

{:#antichrist} Antichrist
: Capped.

{:#anticipate} anticipate
: This verb has been so long misused for *expect* that some dictionaries now give this meaning. But *expect* is shorter and better. The long-accepted meaning of *anticipate* is to foresee and take action against, to forestall. For example, *Anticipating he would lose the election, he applied for another job before the poll.*

{:#antivenom} antivenom
: This has supplanted the term *antivenene*.

{:#any-words} any words
: *Anyone* or *anybody* can do it, but *any one of these women* and *any body of men*; *anyhow*, *anywhere*, *anyway* (*I'll do it anyway*), but *any way* (*I can't see any way of doing it*); *any more*, *any time*.

{:#anzac} Anzac
: For the *Australian and New Zealand Army Corps* of World War I. Rarely do we need to spell it out. *Anzac Day*. *Anzacs* (troops of the corps; also Australian and New Zealand troops in any later alliance, as in Vietnam). Also see **Digger**. (TODO)

{:#armadale} Armadale
: (Vic and WA), but *Armidale* (NSW).

{:#armed-services} armed services
: Cap the full names of the services: the *Australian Army*; the *Royal Australian Navy*; the *Royal Australian Air Force*. But lower case *the army*, *the navy*, *the air force and special forces*. Cap *Army Reserve.* The combined services are *the Australian Defence Force* (not *Forces*); also *the Defence Force*. An *underofficer* is a cadet in all services. Always lower case *acting* when it is necessary to write out acting ranks, e.g. *acting Major John Smith*, but it is correct simply to attribute the rank to the one who is acting in it. When writing service titles cap the unit, formation, branch or organisation. Cap senior positions such as: *the Chief of the Australian Defence Force* (not *Forces*); *the Chairman of the Combined Chiefs of Staff*; *the Commander-in-Chief* and the heads of each of the services, e.g. *the Chief of the Army.* Lower case other positions such as *commanding officer*, *second-in-command*, *executive officer*.
