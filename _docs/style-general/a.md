### abbreviations (acronyms)

Most abbreviations commonly pronounced as words are rendered in caps: _AIDS_, _ANZUS_, _APEC_, _ASEAN_, _ASIO_, _ASIS_, _NASA_, _NATO_, _OPEC_, _UNESCO_, _UNICEF_. Anzac is an exception. Acronyms such as _eftpos_, _laser_, _scuba_ and _radar_ have passed into the language as words in their own right and are all lower case. Accepted abbreviations are listed throughout this guide stating when they can be used at first reference or at second reference after being spelt out in full. Rarely is it necessary to put the abbreviation in brackets immediately after the spelt-out form. Do this only where extra clarity is required, such as for some foreign political party names where the full name is given in English but the abbreviation the party is known by is based on the foreign name.

### abbreviations (honorifics)

Abbreviate only these: _Mr_, _Mrs_, _Messrs_, _Cr_ (for _Councillor_), _Dr_, _St_ (for _Saint_); no full points. (_Ms_, not an abbreviation, is listed elsewhere.) Spell out _Sergeant_, _Lieutenant-General_ and others. Also see [honorifics, St (for Saint)](#linkhere). -->
