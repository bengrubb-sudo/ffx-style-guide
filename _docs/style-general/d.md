### dad

Use with restraint in text and headlines. Cap _mum_ and _dad_ when used in place of a name. "_I told Mum to take the car_," but "_I heard his mum yelling_."

### dais

There is no such word as _dias_.


### Dalai Lama

A title used rather than a name. Cannot be abbreviated.

### damage

Damage is worth nothing, so do not say _$100,000 worth of damage_. Say _the fire caused $100,000 damage_, or _damage estimated at $100,000_.
