**Grammatical Parts**

### nouns

"Naming" words â€“ they name people, places and things. Often divided into proper nouns (_John_, _Melbourne_, _Holden_), common nouns (_man_, _city_, _car_), abstract nouns (_beauty_, _truth_, _science_) and collective nouns (_committee_, _jury_, _team_), although grammarians have many other divisions.

### pronouns

These stand for nouns. Here is the list of personal pronouns: when subject: _I_, _you_, _he_/_she_/_it_, _we_, _you_, _they_. When object: _me_, _you_, _him_/_her_/_it_, _us_, _you_, _them_. Possessive: _my_/_mine_, _your_/_yours_, _his_/_her_/_hers_/_its_, _our_/_ours_/_your_/_yours_/_their_/_theirs_. Other pronouns include _this_, _that_, _these_, _those_, _yourself_, _himself_, _itself_, _anyone_, _someone_, _who_, _what_, _which_.

These are the "doing" or "action" words and "being" words. Verbs have moods, voices and tenses, relating to the time of the action.
