Corrections and clarifications


We have introduced “in-article” corrections and clarifications across the whole newsroom. This mirrors best practice of other leading mastheads around the world.

Our relationship with readers is built on trust and transparency. Readers expect us to be accountable for mistakes and make it clear when we have corrected or clarified stories. We must be open about post-publication changes to copy that we make.

The corrections and clarifications format have been developed with Product. See below for mobile (left) and desktop (right) versions.

The corrections/clarifications field is in the Article Tools section of INK:

Once a story is published reporters and editors are accountable for any changes to the copy. The “not wrong for long” approach to fixing online copy does not apply to us. 


Rules:

We should not clarify or correct a simple spelling mistake or literal. However, any material correction or clarification to copy requires an acknowledgement to our readers whether we receive a complaint or not. 
Reporters must speak with their editor before making a material correction or clarification. Reporters must not change their stories after publication without speaking to their editor. 
Mistakes should be corrected and clarified as soon as they are discovered and regardless of whether the Herald and/or Age has received a complaint. 
We will adopt a consistent approach to reporting online errors. Please use #ed-met-breaking (use @here) channel for mistakes that affect all mastheads or #ed-age-breaking/#ed-smh-breaking for city-specific issues. 
It is not enough to simply write in the corrections field “this story has been updated”. You must spell out what changes were made and why.
All corrections must be done in consultation with Kath Wicks (NSW), Margie Easterbrook (Vic) or Tory Maguire (National) - they can approve the wording of the correction and arrange a print correction if necessary.

In the same way we measure metrics such as completion or engagement, we will measure our corrections and clarifications.
