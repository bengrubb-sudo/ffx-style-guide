### apostrophes
Not used in _quake,_ _flu_, Australian place names (_St Leonards_, _Coffs Harbour_, _Kings Cross_) or names of streets (_Princes Highway_), but keep them in church names (_St Mary's_, _All Saints'_). An initial apostrophe is used when denoting a decade, e.g. the _'70s_. Initials do not take apostrophes in the plural (_two MPs_, _five GPs_).
