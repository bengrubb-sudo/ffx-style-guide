The Herald’s approach to social media mirrors that of the site. Our commitment to brand, loyalty and engagement should be reflected in every choice we make across all our social platforms. The Herald sets itself apart from competitors by offering premium content and inviting them to join the conversation with journalism they cannot get elsewhere. Ultimately, we want the readers to feel they would be getting value for money in paying for our journalism.

IMPORTANT NOTES

If in doubt, have the story/sell legalled before posting. Email lawyers@fairfaxmedia.com.au or prepubs@bhf.com.au - remember to confirm pics are okay too
Please read over your headlines and sells at least two or three times to check for spelling errors/poor grammar. Make sure you’ve tagged the correct people or used the correct handle. Poor subbing is consistently cited as one of the reasons people turn away from the Herald brand

We can now send push alerts from the Herald’s own app through our Apple News Publisher platform. Please ensure you are sending all alerts to both Apple and the SMH app (see the Apple News push notifications section for more information)

There is now a social headline field in INK, please only use this when necessary. It covers both Facebook and Twitter. There’s also a card display which will show you how the story will display on social

The social image field currently has no delete button so if you’ve accidentally used the wrong picture, override it with the original 16x9 index picture

Make sure index images are captioned correctly as these will pull into Apple News. You can correct them in CQ (you’ll need to publish the story after saving it for it to go through)

Provide as much context when possible - especially Twitter 

Avoid clickbait/teasing. If you tease in the headline, provide a “solution” somewhere, whether that be the sell or image

We can’t use NYT, Washington Post or Telegraph UK stories on social. Blended copy is fine

Keep the Year in Review doc up-to-date for the end-of-year wrap video

Breaking news order of business for social

In the instance of breaking news, please take care of these platforms immediately in the following order:

SMH app alert
See also: Apple News → Push notifications
Our readers and subscribers are our most valuable audience. When sent in conjunction with the Apple News alert, the push to the SMH app gets delayed. So please untick the Apple box to send it to the app first

Facebook and Twitter
When it comes to breaking news, a straightforward sell is best and this can be quickly done in Echobox to both social platforms

Apple News alert
Untick the iOs/Android options before sending your Apple alert

As it happens
If news has just broken and there’s no photo available for a post straight away, use our generic breaking news image: https://drive.google.com/a/fairfaxmedia.com.au/file/d/0BykvJY1jUyBdRGQ5eDQ3enVaSEE/view?usp=sharing
You can refresh the share attachment later as the story is updated in Ink
Make sure to use ‘Breaking:’ on Twitter as well as the ‘Breaking’ icon on Facebook. If it’s a big moving story, pin it to the top of our page on Facebook
Tweeting updates to reflect developments in the blog or story is a good idea i.e. fresh reports, figures or quotes. Do this on Facebook by running the story URL through the debugger and refreshing the share attachment, not reposting the story
“What we know so far posts” work well as a fresh woffs or tweets
Make a Twitter/CrowdTangle list based on topic/hashtag and organise by verified accounts - generally a good way to find trends, hashtags, etc
Talk to the journalist running the live blog and editor in charge - keep them up-to-date with what’s happening online


What to watch out for
When news breaks, a lot of information emerges and a lot of the time, the numbers and claims aren’t correct. Make sure you cross-reference with a number of news outlets and journalists before jumping to conclusions whether that be a statistic, photograph, etc.
Keep an eye out for photos we can use for the blog/HP - make sure we always ask if that person/account took the photo and we get permission 
A few stories that work when news breaks (something to keep an eye out on social):
Front pages 
Human interest stories, trending hashtags eg. #PortoOuverte
Local angle/Australians on scene
Watch out for fake news/photos. More and more of this is circulating whenever news breaks. Cross-reference these claims, see if there’s a location/geo-tag on the tweet or Facebook post. Check on Snopes, reverse-Google search the image. Approach every claim with caution

Twitter

Make sure the link is smh.com.au
Maximum one hashtag per tweet, we usually just use #auspol, but trending ones are okay. 
Hashtags go after links. If you can blend the hashtag into the tweet e.g. #Brexit causes chaos, even better
Don’t worry too much about tagging subjects. Just add our journo’s handle if the story is specific to their round and you have spare characters
Try and have as much information in the tweet as possible and provide context, especially if it’s a court/crime story
Treat the tweet like a headline, that is: no fullstops, single hooks for quotes and don’t use a quote as the woff, they appear out of context on TweetDeck and Hootsuite
Do use Twitter to do call-outs for potential eyewitnesses or story subjects (DMs are open), or to contact users to ask if we can use their photos or video
If you are on in the morning, post a .jpeg of the front page (usually emailed around the night before as a .pdf) before 7am with the caption: ‘Good morning. Here's today's front page of the Herald bit.ly/SMHsubscribe’
Share Cathy Wilcox’s cartoon (usually emailed around the night before as a .jpeg) on both Twitter and Facebook with the caption: ‘Today's editorial cartoon by @cathywilcox1’ or ‘Today's editorial cartoon by Cathy Wilcox’ on Facebook
Tag Sport and stepouts e.g. Daily Life, Good Food, Traveller and Good Weekend when using their stories

Additionally, remember to keep the two main lists up-to-date: one is for our federal politics journos, the other is all Herald journalists - add or remove journalists as necessary. They are current as of 9/8/19.

Facebook

Avoid posting stories that are before the courts i.e. anything after the person has been charged
No hashtags unless the story is about a trending hashtag eg #metoo or #illridewithyou
When posting breaking news or exclusives, no need to hashtag or capitalise ‘BREAKING’. This example is acceptable: “Breaking: Malcolm Turnbull elected Prime Minister” 
Use the ‘Breaking’ tag on Facebook for major breaking stories - big political stories tend to work best with this function. Do not use the tag more than once a day. You will need to switch this on in Facebook, not Echobox, by clicking the three dots on the top right and editing the post that way - the breaking tag option will then appear at the bottom, turn it on for 2-3 hours depending on the scale of the story
Try to post at least one video a day, if not more. Commission and post videos you can see are topical and will have a decent lifespan. Please ensure they have a story to accompany so that you can include a Bitly link to it in the post e.g. ‘Read more here: [INSERT LINK HERE]’. Alternately, you could post a link to the relevant story in the comments section. Please be sure to include some context. For stories of national interest, make it available to all pages in Business Manager so other mastheads can cross post. N.b. we cannot share other sites’ content e.g. sport or entertainment-type content unless it is Nine or covered under fair use
Make sure to use the best photo available - cartoons, white backgrounds and generic images are not the best choices. Try and go for a composite image if the story calls for it and you have the time
Tag Sport and stepouts e.g. Daily Life, Good Food, Traveller and Good Weekend when using their stories

Posting on Facebook (style)
Make sure the story is smh.com.au and not brisbanetimes.com.au or theage.com.au
Make sure headline is correct length/social-friendly i.e. not more than one-and-a-half decks
Try to keep the sell to three lines or less as it’ll appear better on mobile. Obviously there are times when you need to go over and that’s fine.
Remember to tag personalities, locations, organisations on Facebook

Breaking news icon
You can add the breaking icon to a post after having shared it via Echobox, by editing the post then click on the breaking logo but it is best to post the link directly on Facebook and to add the tag before posting. 



Select the duration for which the label will appear on the post. To edit the expiration time you have to click on that pencil icon. For most breaking stories, select 3-4 hours. Select the maximum expiration time - 6 hours - if there’s rolling coverage on a live blog.


FYI politics, crime, disaster and business are the most used and best performing topics across the board. Entertainment, celebrity and sports topics are negative across all publishers for CTR so don’t use them with these stories

We can use the icon once per day with an additional five for the month so PLEASE use them only if necessary - and if you know that something is going to happen ahead of time that day e.g. Brexit announcement, then don’t waste it prior.

Instagram

Try and post great photos by Herald photographers most days of the week - check the paper to see what’s around. Use emojis, but sparingly.

Instagram Stories

Besides Photos of the Week (to be shared every Saturday morning), we should only be doing stories of a premium nature, that is, for big features, investigations and products.

Whether supplied by graphics and/or created in PhotoShop. If making your own - make sure they send you graphics/images on a transparent background. Dimensions for stories are 1080px by 1920px

If you need to use it, the “Herald colours” are:
Red - #d9172f 
Blue - #0a1633

This should be uniform across editorial and marketing and these are the exact shades used across the board.

Let’s not go over 7-8 slides if necessary otherwise completion rates will drop off.

Always link to the story in each frame; make a customised Bitly link

Apple News

We should be aiming to get at least 500,000 hits a day, or at least 3.5 million hits by the end of each week. To do this, we need to be assertive with our pitches for the top spots and savvy with our choices. We should make available the quota of at least 16 stories a day every day.

The best choices as far as content to pitch goes includes federal politics, crime, consumer and any other topical/breaking news, especially those stories by our own writers. Make sure there are plenty of photos and a video on the story if it can be helped.

Top Stories
Apple curates a Top Stories list three times a day: 7am, 12pm and 4pm (on weekends there’s an early PM update in lieu of a noon update). If you’re on later, it’s fine to send them updates as strong or breaking stories are published, too.

Use the Slack group to communicate with the team at least half-an-hour before each ‘edition’. Email Chris Burgess (details above) to have yourself added. The Apple News editors will also make requests for stories through this channel. Update the Apple News spreadsheet with the stories you have unlocked.

If you’re not in the channel, email AUAppleNewsAlerts@group.apple.com 30-60 minutes prior to the curation time with pitches (sending URLs is fine). 

If news breaks outside these hours, make sure to make the story unpaid/free in Apple and let them know ASAP so they can take it for the next curation.

Where possible, try and avoid unlocking the same stories as The Age

Spotlight
Generally it’ll feature more features, long reads, op-eds and interviews. Pitch them some options along with your daily Top Stories.

Push notifications

Our alerts now reach both the Apple News environment and the SMH app: the push alert function should strictly be used for breaking news, or quality journalism unique to the Herald (this includes exclusives, investigations, explainers, comment pieces and analysis, and should not be restricted to news only - please remember to show GW features, sport, entertainment and business love where the content has broad appeal.) Importantly, keep the sell or headline straight

Although we don’t want to set a quota on how many push notifications we send, let’s try to get at least one out a day to maintain visibility and brand presence on people’s phones.

With the exception being major breaking news, the commuter windows are typically the most effective time to send alerts. Our audience drops right off after 8.30-9pm and push alerts that lack major news currency tend to have a very low clickthrough rate after this time. If there's a strong story you'd like to send an alert on that isn't so time sensitive, save it for 4-5pm.

We now have an option to include a title on messages sent from our own app, which should function like a kicker. It appears above the message so please use it for special investigations or features eg Crown Unmasked, Journey From the Heart, when sending alerts from the SMH app 

Also, just a friendly reminder - please treat the 'Message' like a headline i.e. no full stops!

Only send an Apple alert when news breaks or if there is an interesting exclusive and/or long read. 

In the instance of breaking news, straightforward sells are fine, but please make sure they are coherent and do not contain any missing words/pronouns.

In the instance of other reads, let's make them more conversational. Don't use the default headline. Sell it like you would a write-off, make it engaging, keep it straight

If a story has been updated in the CMS, it’ll need to be manually updated in Apple (i.e. update the story again in News Publisher)

If there is an error in the photo caption it’ll most likely be due to index captions not being filled out properly. You can fix this in INK/check crops in CQ. Then manually update again in Apple - you’ll need to republish the story in CQ, but only if the story has already been published in Ink

Note: Instagram embeds do not currently work and will continually fail to unlock unless removed from the article. Certain categories do not pull through because of CQ issues, including environment and technology. If you want to use these stories in Apple, you’ll have to push them through manually

Sending a push notification
Make sure the ‘Paid’ box has been unticked and the story has been updated, then click ‘New Push Notification’ and a drop down box will appear. Like with the breaking news order of business, send the alert to the SMH app first. Make sure to untick the ‘Apple News’ box …

Use the ‘Title’ field to indicate if a story is part of an investigative series (e.g. Crown Unmasked), an exclusive, comment, analysis, perspective piece etc. N.b. text in the ‘Title’ field only appears on the Herald app, not in the Apple News alert 


Hit ‘Create Notification’ et voila!

Repeat the process again for the Apple News alert …
